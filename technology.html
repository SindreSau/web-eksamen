                <h2>The politics of infrastructure</h2>
                <p>The internet has become increasingly necessary in societies day to day lives and is no longer an accessory but rather a necessary tool in almost all aspects of life. In recent years there has been increasing scrutiny over the impact and importance of the internet. Social media platforms Facebook and Twitter have both received intense socio-political scrutiny over the impact of their ads, the prevalence of fake accounts and their potential impact on events such as the US presidential election (Wells & McMillan, 2017). This phenomenon has had large impacts on elections and society on a global level. The lack of consequences that are brought upon by the internet due to the mass supply of information and misinformation seems to be the issue. Misinformation regarding contemporary issues such as the COVID-19 pandemic has been a focal point in highlighting the weight of the internet and the reach that it has on society (Suarez-Lledo & Alvarez- Galvez, 2021). Notable positive consequences include improving the reach of education, efficiency of organizations and giving more people voices that can benefit the socio-political structure of the world (Siddiqui & Singh, 2016). It is difficult to quantitate the precise political impact of the internet, however it is crucial that we continue to be critical of the internet in order to remain cautiously optimistic about the impact of the internet.</p>

                <h2>Responsible Research and Innovation</h2>
                <p>Our group found it intriguing discussing the societal responsibility of technological innovation. A balance between creative freedom, hindering stagnation and at the same time taking societal needs into consideration became our main talking points. To begin with we talked about how rules and obligations might suppress innovation but realized that there needs to be some form of control group. The analogy of Frankenstein ́s monster (1. Latour, 2012) highlights the difficulties that come with technological innovation, but more so it reminds us of the importance of how new technology is applied and maintained. This brought further discussion on whether entrepreneurs such as Mark Zuckerberg are to be held solely responsible for consequences, both positive and negative, brought on by their ICT- platforms. Zuckerberg states that his intention is to “give people voice, and bring people together” (2). At the same time, there is concern with the spreading of lies and propaganda through platforms such as Facebook (3). This leads to the question of whether it should be the innovator, the corporate, an expert-group or perhaps the government that has the final say in whether the technology is beneficial or needs to adapt to societal needs. Quoting Latour to conclude on the subject matter: “Dr. Frankenstein's crime was not that he invented a creature through some combination of hubris and high technology, but rather that he abandoned the creature to itself.” Similarly, it seems fitting to imagine it as a necessary common goal to uphold societal values, and not leave the responsibility in the hands of the innovator.</p>
